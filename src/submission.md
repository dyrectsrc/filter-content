## Given more time, what would you have done differently?

I would of used Redux or the Context hook for state management.

## How did you deviate from the directions, if at all, and why?

The endpoint giving back a 404 error. I retrieved data locally. I did not, but would of used useEffect and maybe axios to fetch data. More refactoring needs to be done to make the code more DRY. Some more CSS styling need to be added.

## Is there anything else you'd like to let us know?

Used create-react-app to create repository.
